<!-- How to pronouce my first name: "<b>Shesing</b>". -->
<b>Human-AI Interaction Researcher</b>

Hello!ðŸ‘‹ I am a Computer Science PhD student at the [Sanghani Center for Artificial Intelligence & Data Analytics](https://sanghani.cs.vt.edu/about/) at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu/). My advisor is Prof. [Chris North](https://people.cs.vt.edu/north/). During my first year, I was advised by Prof. [Yalong Yang](https://ivi.cc.gatech.edu/people.html). Prior to joining Virginia Tech, I worked for about 3 years primarily as a machine learning engineer on large-scale recommendation systems. I earned both my B.S. and M.S. degrees from [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/), where I was mentored by Prof. Zhijiang Li and Dr. [Fan Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K3SZuHIAAAAJ&hl=en). During my M.S., I also visited and collaborated with Prof. [Xiu Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Xrh1OIUAAAAJ&hl=en) from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).

My research interest lies in the intersection of Visualization, Human-Computer Interaction, and Artificial Intelligence, where I use visual analytics and human-in-the-loop methods to design, build, and evaluate human-AI collaborative systems to enhance the efficiency, trustworthiness, and transparency of AI models. 

<b>I am looking for internship positions for summer 2025. With experience in human-AI collaboration and large language models, I am excited to apply my skills in a dynamic environment. If your organization is seeking a dedicated and passionate intern, Iâ€™d love to connect!</b>

<!-- Last summer, I was a visiting PhD student in the [HCIE Group](https://hcie.csail.mit.edu/) at CSAIL, MIT. -->

<!-- With three years in top tech companies, I am a <b>full-stack developer</b> and <b>AI Applied Researcher</b>. My current research lies on <b>Information Visualization</b>, <b>Immersive Analytics</b>, and <b>Human-AI Interaction</b>. 

Furthermore, as a <b>HCI researcher</b>, I firmly place humans at the core. My ultimate goal is <b>equip individuals</b> with the capability to comprehensively comprehend and effectively derive insights from <b>vast multimodal information and environments</b>, achieved through the synergistic integration of AI and visualization techniques. -->
