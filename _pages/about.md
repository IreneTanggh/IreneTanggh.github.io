<!-- How to pronouce my first name: "<b>Shesing</b>". -->
<b>Human-AI Interaction Researcher</b>

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a Computer Science PhD student at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu/)'s [Sanghani Center for Artificial Intelligence & Data Analytics](https://sanghani.cs.vt.edu/about/), co-advised by Prof. [Chris North](https://people.cs.vt.edu/north/) and [Xuan Wang](https://xuanwang91.github.io/). 
Before joining Virginia Tech, I spent nearly three years in industry, starting as a full-stack development engineer before advancing to machine learning engineering where I worked on large-scale recommendation systems.
I hold both B.S. and M.S. degrees from [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/), where I was mentored by Prof. Zhijiang Li and Dr. [Fan Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K3SZuHIAAAAJ&hl=en). During my master's program, I had the valuable opportunity to visit and collaborate with Prof. [Xiu Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Xrh1OIUAAAAJ&hl=en) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).

My research explores the intersection of Visualization, Human-Computer Interaction, and Large Language Models, where I develop visual analytics and human-in-the-loop methods to design, build, and evaluate efficient, trustworthy, and transparent human-LLM collaborative systems.

<b>I am seeking internship opportunities for Summer 2025. With specialized experience in human-AI collaboration and large language models, I'm eager to contribute my expertise in a dynamic environment. If your organization values innovation at the frontier of human-AI interaction, I would be delighted to connect!</b>

<!-- Last summer, I was a visiting PhD student in the [HCIE Group](https://hcie.csail.mit.edu/) at CSAIL, MIT. -->

<!-- With three years in top tech companies, I am a <b>full-stack developer</b> and <b>AI Applied Researcher</b>. My current research lies on <b>Information Visualization</b>, <b>Immersive Analytics</b>, and <b>Human-AI Interaction</b>. 

Furthermore, as a <b>HCI researcher</b>, I firmly place humans at the core. My ultimate goal is <b>equip individuals</b> with the capability to comprehensively comprehend and effectively derive insights from <b>vast multimodal information and environments</b>, achieved through the synergistic integration of AI and visualization techniques. -->
