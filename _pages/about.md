<!-- How to pronouce my first name: "<b>Shesing</b>". -->

I am currently a first-year PhD student in Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech, advised by Prof. [Yalong Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=B2Qy_xAAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). I am also a visiting PhD student in the [HCIE Group](https://hcie.csail.mit.edu/) at CSAIL, MIT.

With three years in top tech companies, I am a <b>full-stack developer</b> and <b>AI Applied Researcher</b>. My current research lies on <b>Information Visualization</b>, <b>Immersive Analytics</b>, and <b>Human-AI Interaction</b>. 

Furthermore, as a <b>HCI researcher</b>, I firmly place humans at the core. My ultimate goal is <b>equip individuals</b> with the capability to comprehensively comprehend and effectively derive insights from <b>vast multimodal information and environments</b>, achieved through the synergistic integration of AI and visualization techniques.
