<!-- How to pronouce my first name: "<b>Shesing</b>". -->
<b>Human-AI Collaboration Researcher</b>

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a Computer Science PhD student at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu/)'s [Sanghani Center for Artificial Intelligence & Data Analytics](https://sanghani.cs.vt.edu/about/), co-advised by Prof. [Chris North](https://people.cs.vt.edu/north/) and [Xuan Wang](https://xuanwang91.github.io/). My research explores the intersection of Human-AI Collaboration and Large Language Models, where I develop visual analytics and human-in-the-loop methods to design, build, and evaluate efficient, trustworthy, and transparent human-LLM collaborative systems.

Before joining Virginia Tech, I spent nearly three years in industry, starting as a full-stack development engineer before advancing to machine learning engineering where I worked on large-scale recommendation systems.
I hold both B.S. and M.S. degrees from [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/), where I was mentored by Prof. Zhijiang Li and Dr. [Fan Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K3SZuHIAAAAJ&hl=en). Throughout my PhD and master's studies, I've had the privilege of collaborating with distinguished researchers from premier institutions including MIT, Georgia Tech, Tsinghua University, City University of Hong Kong, and Adobe Research, among others.

<b>I am actively seeking a Summer 2026 internship where I can apply my expertise in human-AI collaborative systems and human-AI alignment. I am eager to contribute to a research-driven team tackling complex challenges at the frontier of human-AI interaction. If your organization is innovating in this space, I would be delighted to connect and discuss how my skills can bring value.</b>

<!-- Last summer, I was a visiting PhD student in the [HCIE Group](https://hcie.csail.mit.edu/) at CSAIL, MIT. -->

<!-- With three years in top tech companies, I am a <b>full-stack developer</b> and <b>AI Applied Researcher</b>. My current research lies on <b>Information Visualization</b>, <b>Immersive Analytics</b>, and <b>Human-AI Interaction</b>. 

Furthermore, as a <b>HCI researcher</b>, I firmly place humans at the core. My ultimate goal is <b>equip individuals</b> with the capability to comprehensively comprehend and effectively derive insights from <b>vast multimodal information and environments</b>, achieved through the synergistic integration of AI and visualization techniques. -->
